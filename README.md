# Wordle-Solver
A small python programme that helps solve the daily Wordle (at https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) with user input

It receive the letters known from users and the letters' positions (if the user knows the position), and then searches through a .txt file of all english 5 letter words to find suitable words. 

It is rather messy in my opinion, and i think i could make it more effective. I am sure there is a better way to do it but this was my solution lol :)

## Next Steps
I probably will update this to make it somewhat better, and if i think of a better way to do it i will probably implement that. I am probably gonna add something that lets you input letters that you know *aren't* in the word, so it can filter the results down even more.
